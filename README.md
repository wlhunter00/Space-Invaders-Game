# Space-Invaders-Game
Game modeled after space invaders I made in Junior Year in Processing. You control the triangle, and the goal of the game is to shoot the enemies before they reach the bottom of the screen. If the enemies reach the bottom of the screen you lose a life, if you lose three lives the game ends, you get presented the score and the option to restart. There are two types of enemies, normal enemies and shielded enimies. The shielded enemies take two shots to kill them.
